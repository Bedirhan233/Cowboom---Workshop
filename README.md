# Cowboom - Workshop

Hello!

The theme for that week's game jam was 'Kaboom.' We decided to make a game about a farmer protecting his cow against aliens. This was the first game I worked on in a group, where I was one of the developers. My responsibilities was player movement, shooting and sxf.

The movement script was very simple. I used a rigidbody with simple physics. The scale of the game was not very big, so the movement worked fine.

The shooting mechanic was a bit challenging because it was the first time I wrote a mechanic for a gun that shoots five bullets in different directions. I handled the problem by creating empty objects with different directions. If I were to remake this script now, I would probably use math calculations to determine the five positions and rotations.
